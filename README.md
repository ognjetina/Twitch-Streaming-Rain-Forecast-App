# Twitch-Streaming-Rain-Forecast-App

All repos that are starting with Twitch-Streaming are repositores I made while live streaming on twitch.

Most of this projects are fun projects that I made while taking ideas and wishes of my twitch chat audience.

By this said, the code is preaty much dirty and you should not fool yourself in thinking this is the best practice to code.

If you where not watching the stream most of this will not make sense.
